# A simple time registration system in ASP.NET Core

This code was developed as part of interviewing to a job in June of 2017. The task was to implement a simple web application
that solves the following two user stories:
- As a freelancer I want to be able to register the time I spend on my projects, so that I
can create correct invoices for my customers.
 - As a freelancer I want to be able to get an overview of my time registrations, so that I
can create correct invoices for my customers.

The goal of the task was not to implement a full system, but have the basis of a good chat about software development practices etc.

The code was developed with the latest version of ASP.NET Core (cross-platform .NET) at the time (RC1 from November 2015).
It uses in-memory storage for the demo, so data is lost whenever the AppPool in recycled.

A live version of the code is deployed here: http://timeregdemo.azurewebsites.net/
